            We are a small family from the land, and we started this because we wanted to share what we grow and press—the same way our grandparents did. Bull-driven oil isn’t a gimmick for us; it’s how we’ve always done it. The bull turns the wooden press slowly, and the oil that comes out is cold, pure, and untouched by machines or chemicals.

            For us, natural farming means no synthetic fertilisers, no pesticides, and no shortcuts. Our millets and rice come from our fields. Our oils come from seeds we trust. We don’t sell anything we wouldn’t use in our own kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you buy from us, you’re buying from people who care about the land and the way things used to be made. We’re not a big brand—we’re a real, honest local store that’s now online so more people can get pure, traditional products.
